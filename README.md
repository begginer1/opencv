## Introduction
A code for rotating a image using opencv                                                                                                                                            
OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in todayâ€™s systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human.
